<!-- Project Proposal -->
<h3>Project Proposal</h3>
<h4>Summary Figure</h4>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
Our objective is to develop an image classification model to detect if an 
individual in a picture is wearing a mask through the use of convolutional 
neural networks. In order to perform this, we plan on using feature extraction 
in combination with other techniques, such as binary classification. 
Specifically for feature extraction, we plan on extracting a minimal set of 
features, in this case, masks, from multiple images that contain high 
amounts of object or scene information from low-level image pixel values. 
In doing so, we will be able to capture the difference among the object 
categories involved. Our baseline algorithm will have input images of 
people wearing masks, classified as 1, and people not wearing masks, 
classified as 0. 

<br>
<br>

Currently, there is no smart way of monitoring continuous mask wearing 
in public spaces. Wearing masks is only monitored upon entrance into 
certain facilities by human, phone, or tablet. Motorola Solutions and 
other Artificial Intelligence startup companies are in the process of 
developing face mask recognition surveillance softwares for airlines and 
cities.

<h4>Methods</h4>
Our approach monitors mask wearing throughout a continuous time frame, 
and does not require people to stop for seconds to verify on a certain 
device that they are wearing masks. It will be able to be implemented on 
wide scale surveillance systems, including schools and hospitals.

<br>
<br>
For this project, in terms of the risks, it could be hard to identify 
masks including masks that are not single colored or even have features 
of faces printed on them. The quality of the image would need to be easy 
to see to better match the masks.

<br>
<br>
In terms of the cost, it will cost a large amount of image space and data 
processing, but otherwise, the pictures should be free-to-use. 

<br>
<br>
We ideally see ourselves spending the next two months of our project 
gathering data and testing our multiple different experimental methods. 
At the end, we hope to obtain a feasible model that can be readily 
utilized. 

<h4>Discussion</h4>
As of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a tremendous impact on 
individuals worldwide. By developing a model that can successfully 
identify if individuals are wearing masks, we will be able to assist 
in minimizing the spread of the virus. Information obtained from this 
model can be used in areas, such as research and government. 
For instance, if the CDC wanted to understand the spread of the 
virus better, they would need to know how well it is being 
contained-- our research could help shed light into this. 

<br>
<br>
In order to check for success in the mid-term, we would like to have a 
working model that contains the initial stages of image classification. 
By the final stage, we want to be able to implement the model and have 
it output accurate information.
